* `myobject.method(arg1, arg2)` == `MyClass.method(myobject, arg1, arg2)`
* `@classmethod` and `@staticmethod` decorators 
* instance methods, class methods and static methods
* `__str__` and `__repr__` methods
* [Why private attribute, if we are to include a getter/setter for that same attribute?](https://stackoverflow.com/a/18845732)
* the `__del__` method
* purpose of properties: to change the implementation without having to change the interface
